      "story": "Seven mystical islands once slept in the Arabian Sea, home to fisherfolk and the goddess Mumbadevi. When the British came seeking a port, they saw the islands' potential but didn't know the secret - the islands were protected by the goddess. It's said that Mumbai grew from a sleepy fishing village to a bustling metropolis because Mumbadevi blessed the land, bringing dreams from across India to find a home here.
